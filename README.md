# react-native-imagepicker

A React Native module which wraps [ActionSheetIOS](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/actionsheetios.html#content),
 [CameraRoll](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#content) and
 undocummented [ImagePickerIOS](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/CameraRoll/ImagePickerIOS.js)
 to select a photo from the library or camera. No external plugins needed.
